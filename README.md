**Technical Assistance services.**
Technical assistance and support in the areas of Energy Transition, Digital Transformations, Sustainable Environmental Management, Climate Change, Waste Management, Rule of Law and Access to Justice, Water through HR, procurement, construction, contract management, fund, program management services, development, delivery and management of the portfolio of engagements in the selected country.
With a focus on energy efficiency, fossil fuel-based and renewable energy based projects, to provide a technical advisory support, holistic support to non government, public sector organisations (UN, UNOPS, UNEP, UNIDO, UNDP, UNECE, etc.) and national/local governments on financing and technical needs, capacity and skill development, and facilitation of dialogues in all related areas.

Technical Assistance services:

**1. Project Design**

**2. Technical and Coordination Support**

**3. Support Private Sector Engagement**


**1. Project Design and Portfolio Development**
•	Support in drafting and refinement of Terms of References (TOR) for technical assistance projects, incorporating technical, financial/economic, and stakeholder input, including:
•	Conducting research and analysis to inform TOR development.
•	Identifying and engaging with relevant stakeholders (e.g. government agencies/ministries, private sector actors, civil society organizations, others) to gather input and ensure alignment.
•	Participate in the evaluation of proposals to select project implementing partners or consultants.
•	Support in building technical assistance project portfolio by scoping for emerging fields in the energy sector, identifying potential focus areas, understanding the needs, and assessing private sector interest.
•	To support the transition towards modern energy systems to ensure economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability, enabling the transition toward greener energy systems and contributing to the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agreement objectives.
•	Technical assistance, including market studies, regulatory assessments, and other technical studies, focusing on pre-identified areas on energy transition, to foster greater private sector participation in energy transition in countries by clarifying private sector opportunities, and understanding and addressing potential barriers to scaling up their participation.


**2. Technical Assistance and Coordination Support**
•	Provide technical and operational support to the implementing partners/consultants, as necessary (linking them with stakeholders, strategizing on the conduct of activities, and reviewing project outputs).  
•	To participate in meetings with implementing partners, progress and strategy meetings, engagement with other stakeholders meetings.
•	Support other activities and projects (participation in workshops or stakeholder engagement, providing feedback on project outputs, and other tasks).
•	Inform on potential issues or risks on any of the technical assistance projects to devise solutions.

**3. Support Stakeholders’ and Private Sector Engagement**
•	Identify and initiate engagement with key private sector actors, stakeholders’ mapping, engagement and coordination (developers, investors, industry associations) relevant to the technical assistance focus areas.
•	Support private sector acceleration in the energy transition sectors:
•	Risk Mitigation: Project and sector-level analysis of critical risks creating barriers to project realisation (creating risk-sharing mechanisms, insurance options, or guarantees to attract private capital).
•	Market Transparency: Ensuring transparency in energy markets to build investor confidence. Clear information on market conditions, energy prices, and potential thus allowing private companies to make informed investment decisions.
•	Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Collaboration between the public and private sectors through PPPs to facilitate the development and implementation of large-scale clean energy projects.
•	Climate Disclosure and Reporting: Implementing standardized climate disclosure and reporting mechanisms to help investors assess and compare the environmental performance of different companies, to attract socially responsible investors.
•	Project preparation: prefeasibility and feasibility studies, pathway to financing, project planning, permitting pathways and convening key public and private stakeholders to ensure successful implementation and long-term success.
